# Source-to-Target Validation Test Pack (SQL)

## Objective
Create a structured validation test pack to confirm data accuracy, completeness, and business-rule consistency between a legacy/source dataset and a migrated/target dataset.

## Validation Areas Covered
- Record count reconciliation (overall + by key dimensions)
- Completeness checks (nulls, blanks, unexpected values)
- Business rule validation (calculated fields, mappings)
- Duplicate detection and key integrity checks
- Variance thresholds and exception reporting

## Deliverables
- Repeatable SQL validation scripts (JOINs, CTEs)
- Test case checklist with expected vs actual results
- Issue log template for defects and resolution tracking

## Skills Demonstrated
SQL (JOINs, CTEs), Source-to-Target Reconciliation, Data Validation, Data Quality, Root Cause Analysis, Documentation
